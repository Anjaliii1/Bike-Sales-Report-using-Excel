#### STEPS FOLLOWED :
               1. Prepare Your Dataset:
                   a. Import Your Data: Open Excel and import your bike buyers dataset (CSV, Excel file, etc.).
                   b. Clean Your Data: Check for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. Make sure the data is in a tabular format.
                   c. Organize Your Data: Ensure each column represents a variable (e.g., Age, Gender, Purchase Price, Region, Location) and each row represents a buyer.
                   d. Convert the raw dataset into the working dataset.
               2. Analyze the Data:
                   a. Identify Key Metrics: Decide what metrics you want to track (e.g.average purchase price, number of buyers by category).
                   b. Create Calculated Columns: Use Excel formulas to create any necessary calculated fields, such as profit margins or customer segments. 
               3. Create Pivot Tables:
                   a. Insert Pivot Tables: Go to the Insert tab and select PivotTable. Choose your data range.
                   b. Set Up Your Pivot Tables: Drag and drop fields to summarize data. For example:

                                  * Number of buyers by Country.
                                  * Average age of buyers.
                   c. Customize Your Pivot Tables: Format them for readability, using appropriate number formats and styles.
               4. Create Visualizations:
                   a. Insert Charts: Use the Insert tab to create various charts (e.g., bar, line) based on your pivot tables.
                   b. Choose the Right Chart Types: Select chart types that best represent your data (e.g.,  line chart for Age Brackets, bar chartt for average income per purchase).
                   c. Format Charts: Customize chart colors, labels, and titles for clarity.
               5. Design Your Dashboard Layout:
                   a. Create a New Sheet for the Dashboard: Add a new worksheet that will serve as your dashboard.
                   b. Arrange Your Elements: Place your charts, pivot tables, and key metrics in a logical order. Ensure itâ€™s visually appealing and easy to read.
                   c. Add Slicers: Use slicers to enable interactivity. Go to the PivotTable Analyze tab, select Insert Slicer, and choose relevant fields (e.g.education, region, Marital status).
